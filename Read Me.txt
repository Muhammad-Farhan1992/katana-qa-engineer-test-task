Implementation:
The implementation for current project includes three major components. These components are given below:
	1. Visual Studio Code: It is used as an IDE for doing the automation code.
	2. Cypress: It is used for the Web Automation/Web Testing and API Automation.
	3. TypeScript: Programming language used with Cypress.
	
Below is the directory hierarchy of the project:
	1. fixtures: This folder contains the files used in the project. Examples are data files and payload files.
	2. e2e: This folder contains the files related to the Test Cases. Whenever we open Cypress Window by
	   using command "npx cypress open", "npm run api", or "npm run ui" files from this folder will be executed.
	3. support: This folder is used for common files, business logic files, or another files we might need.
	4. page_objects: This contains the files and functions related to the Page Object Model(POM).
	5. common_functions: This contains the functions that are used commonly.
	6. validation_funcitons: This contians the functions for the validations.
